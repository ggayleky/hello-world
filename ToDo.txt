Tableau POC
	PolicyDescriptor and attributes
		Test whether Tableau should reference StgDimPolicySymbol (or other RSDM table)
			and whether we can join to it effectively
		Revisit Sector/Category/PacCode2 for new policies
			Look at signatures in each group
	Test dual-axis with open data
	

Macro
	Possibly make smarter to only add columns if missing
	
	Extract usage
		Can extracts be made available for biz team
			Check with Amanda

	LatLongZip
		Best zip column, and issues with other columns
	
	Identify workbooks that sometimes have multiple worksheets
	
	Logging? How do we diagnose a problem?
	

Pat
	Rally stories moved to validation
	ESRI and Isaac
	Refinement: Jon presents and I add color
	Walkthrough productionalization
		Who can post?
			Who owns the content for each table?
				Enrollment and Location
				LatLong
				PolicyDescriptor
	
InsuredID and EffectiveDate
	Improve queries for 2665933
	What are the other policies that need this?
		Premier?
	Missing effective date
		RE UMXS, 1744100, 2660173
	Determine whether DPG can provide these fields in the missing files

Identify derived policies
	Get policy numbers
	xquery/xslt

LatLong
	Google version
		Rename GeoPlay1 to something
		Deploy somewhere
	
	Test size of inbound files
		Combine 2-4-8, etc
	
	Process improvement plans
		More history
		ESRI geocoding?
		Break apart multiple addresses
			Provide guidelines to DPG

	May need a way to join to LatLong for crime data
		Attrib for 500 block of Vine
	
Cleanup
	Identify files, scripts, et al that are part of deployment.
	Resume building instructions
	
ML
	Often used queries
	Build 2-3 categories of workspaces:
		databases, forests, schemas, app severs, etc
		templates
		operational queries, such as derived policies
		analytical and discovery queries
	
Mock up execution 
	enrollments
	location

PowerShell
	Figure a way to resume where we left off
	Get files more recent than X, where x is stored somewhere

Consider copying xlsx to our area
	Then move to InboundDocs after macro execution
	If file exists, that is, has already been moved, overwrite
	
Consider flattening the Inbound folder, to imitate the Bordereaux folder

Consider file-movement model
	Interim landings for
		inbound
		xml
		?
	Always start at the step closest to ML
	Pull all the way through to ML
	Once interim pipeline is clear, then pull from new source content
	Plan for a way to include logging in the process
	
Risk Radar?

Premium reconciliation
	powershell?
	Identify policies where premium gets trued-up annually
	

Writeup for SEI?
Writeup for GAI?

Re-enable Veracity template?
Archive it?

Assemble ML questions
	How do I incorporate document uri in sql results
	Can/should I add the expression into the template?
	
Does URI naming convention need work?
